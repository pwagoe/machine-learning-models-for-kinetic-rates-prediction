All self-written code with exceptions: "feature_calc" and "dataset_operations", which were provided by Group Member Iris Guo


Models folder contains: 

NN (Neural Network models):

- NN1 for the ligand feature variatiolns
- NN2 for an automated protein feature variation across all available Propy3 descriptors
- Hyperparameter tuning, based on the best R^2 on validation attained from NN1 and NN2

GNN (Graph Neural Network model)
